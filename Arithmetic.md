<h3> Natural Numbers </h3>
All counting numbers are called natural numbers which are denoted by N.

Example: N ={1, 2 , 3 , 4 , 5..... $\infty$}

<h3> Whole Numbers</h3>
All counting numbers together with zero are called whole numbers. They are denoted by W.

Example: W ={0, 1, 2 , 3 , 4 , 5..... $\infty$}
